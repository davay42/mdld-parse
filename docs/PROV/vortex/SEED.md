# SEED {=tag:seed:catalog .prov:Entity}
> The foundational Goal Entity that initiates the PROV-O vortex catalog - the first particle around which all provenance will organize and circulate. {?comment}

## 🌱 The First Particle

This SEED entity represents the **initial vacuum state** around which our PROV-O vortex will form. Like the first particle in a smoke ring, it provides the organizing principle for all subsequent provenance structures.

### **Core Properties**

**Identity**: [PROV-O Catalog Implementation] {rdfs:label}
**Type**: [Seed Goal] {rdf:type}
**Created**: [2026-02-24T12:00:00Z] {prov:generatedAtTime ^^xsd:dateTime}
**Purpose**: [Bootstrap provenance system for AI-human collaboration] {dc:description}

## 📋 Initial Vortex Conditions

### **Pre-Vortex State**
- **Zero Entropy**: No existing provenance structure
- **High Potential**: Maximum organizational freedom
- **Clean Slate**: No preconceptions or constraints

### **Vortex Formation Requirements**
1. **Central Axis**: Clear, achievable Goal definition
2. **Surface Tension**: Minimal initial constraints (SHACL shapes)
3. **Fluid Medium**: MDLD documents ready for circulation
4. **Initial Impulse**: Human decision to begin catalog

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The SEED is successful when:

- ✅ **Catalog Genesis**: First PROV-O page created from this Goal
- ✅ **Vortex Initiation**: Initial circulation pattern established
- ✅ **Template Foundation**: Standard structure for all subsequent pages
- ✅ **Human Alignment**: Goal reflects genuine intent for provenance tracking

## 🔄 From Seed to Vortex

Once this SEED entity is established, the natural progression follows the **Paper Vortex** pattern:

1. **Zone A**: Define catalog structure (Plan)
2. **Zone B**: Create implementation pages (Activities)  
3. **Zone C**: Generate provenance traces (Statements/Collections)

The SEED becomes the **organizing principle** that transforms high-entropy ideas about provenance into a structured, low-entropy knowledge system - exactly as described in Phase 0 of our PLAN.md.

*This SEED.md represents the moment of decision - the first particle in what will become a self-organizing PROV-O vortex of trustworthy, validated provenance information.*
