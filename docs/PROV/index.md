# MDLD PROV-O Catalog {=cat:index .Container label}

> A comprehensive guide to PROV-O provenance modeling in MDLD (Markdown Linked Data). This catalog defines the core, extended, and advanced provenance patterns used to describe entities, activities, agents, and their relationships in decentralized knowledge systems. {?comment}

This catalog [includes] {+cat:includes .rdf:Property label} the most relevant and practically used terms from PROV-O for human- and agent-authored knowledge graphs.

---

## Core Provenance Model {=class:CoreModel .cat:Model label}

The core PROV model defines the fundamental building blocks of provenance graphs. These terms account for the vast majority of real-world provenance data.

### Core Classes {=#classes .Container label}

There are 3 core class in PROV-O

* Entity {=prov:Entity .Class}
* Activity {=prov:Activity .Class}
* Agent {=prov:Agent .Class}

### Core Relations

* Was Generated By {=prov:wasGeneratedBy}
* Used {=prov:used}
* Was Derived From {=prov:wasDerivedFrom}
* Was Attributed To {=prov:wasAttributedTo}
* Was Associated With {=prov:wasAssociatedWith}

### Temporal Properties

* Generated At Time {=prov:generatedAtTime}
* Started At Time {=prov:startedAtTime}
* Ended At Time {=prov:endedAtTime}

> These terms form the practical backbone of provenance in knowledge graphs, data pipelines, and decentralized event systems. {?comment}

---

## Delegation & Responsibility {+class:Delegation .Class label}

Delegation models responsibility chains between agents. This is especially important in agentic and automated systems.

* Acted On Behalf Of {=prov:actedOnBehalfOf}

> Delegation is increasingly important for AI agents, automated workflows, and multi-actor systems. {?comment}

---

## Qualified Provenance {+class:QualifiedProvenance .Class label}

Qualified relations allow attaching additional metadata to provenance relations.

### Qualification Properties

* Qualified Generation {=prov:qualifiedGeneration}
* Qualified Usage {=prov:qualifiedUsage}
* Qualified Association {=prov:qualifiedAssociation}
* Qualified Attribution {=prov:qualifiedAttribution}
* Qualified Derivation {=prov:qualifiedDerivation}

### Qualification Structures

* Generation {=prov:Generation .Class}
* Usage {=prov:Usage .Class}
* Association {=prov:Association .Class}
* Attribution {=prov:Attribution .Class}
* Derivation {=prov:Derivation .Class}

> Qualified provenance enables rich, inspectable event descriptions but is used selectively due to added modeling complexity. {?comment}

---

## Derivation & Versioning {+class:Versioning .Class label}

Versioning relations describe how entities evolve over time. These are highly relevant for decentralized and event-based systems.

* Was Revision Of {=prov:wasRevisionOf}
* Specialization Of {=prov:specializationOf}
* Alternate Of {=prov:alternateOf}

> These relations are especially important for systems with edits, forks, replaceable events, and repost semantics. {?comment}

---

## Collections & Bundles {+class:Collections .Class label}

These terms describe grouped provenance structures.

### Collection Types

* Collection {=prov:Collection .Class}
* Bundle {=prov:Bundle .Class}

### Membership

* Had Member {=prov:hadMember}

> Collections are useful for dataset packaging and workflow grouping but are less common in lightweight event streams. {?comment}

---

## Influence Relations {+class:InfluenceFamily .Class label}

The influence family provides a more general causal model. These terms are part of the full PROV-O vocabulary but are less commonly used in practice.

* Influence {=prov:Influence .Class}
* Was Influenced By {=prov:wasInfluencedBy}
* Was Started By {=prov:wasStartedBy}
* Was Ended By {=prov:wasEndedBy}
* Was Informed By {=prov:wasInformedBy}
* Was Invalidated By {=prov:wasInvalidatedBy}

> These provide expressive causal modeling but are rarely required for most MDLD use cases. {?comment}

---

## Roles & Plans {+class:RolesAndPlans .Class label}

Roles and plans describe contextual responsibilities within activities.

### Role Modeling

* Role {=prov:Role .Class}
* Had Role {=prov:hadRole}

### Planning

* Plan {=prov:Plan .Class}
* Had Plan {=prov:hadPlan}

> Useful for workflow systems and formal process modeling; optional for most decentralized knowledge graphs. {?comment}

---

## Location (Optional) {+class:Location .Class label}

Spatial context for entities and activities.

* At Location {=prov:atLocation}

> Location metadata is occasionally useful but not required for most provenance graphs. {?comment}

---

## Recommended Practical Coverage {=cat:CoverageGuide .Container label}

In real-world decentralized and agentic systems:

* **Core Model** → ~80–90% of usage  
* **Delegation** → rapidly growing importance  
* **Qualified Provenance** → selective but powerful  
* **Versioning relations** → highly relevant for event systems  
* **Collections & Influence** → situational  
* **Roles/Plans & Location** → optional  

> MDLD authors are encouraged to start with the Core Model and add advanced constructs only when required by the use case. {?comment}

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each term in this catalog will include:

* ✅ Valid MDLD examples  
* ❌ Invalid patterns where relevant  
* 🧩 Recommended authoring patterns  
* 🔍 SHACL validation guidance  

This catalog aims to balance:

- human-readable narrative provenance  
- machine-verifiable structure  
- streaming-friendly MDLD authoring  
- compatibility with decentralized event systems  
```
